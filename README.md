*cue cold open*

[chorus]

I didn't start the fire,

'Cause I'm always learning

Since the world's been turning;

I didn't start the fire

At first, I didn't get it

Hope I don't forget it

[end]


Thanks I'll be here all week


Hello! I'm Ian. I'm a recent bootcamp graduate, and now I'm immersed in the world of the head-spinning JOB SEARCH. Like, literally every day. Thankfully I have fun projects to work on to keep me sane. Oh yeah, and I had fun making this banner! Yep, the banner is 100% being used on my LinkedIn as well, which can conveniently be found below. 

I'm curious about languages and tools I don't know and I like to learn how to use them so I can give them meaningful applications, in.. well, applications. I also create music as witnessed ^above^ and enjoy many many other things, like nature and outdoor recreation, astronomy, mental health, and video games.. so coyotes, walking by coyotes, supernovas, fidget-spinners, and an old 90's game called Heroes of Might and Magic (thank you New World Computing) are all solid examples. Oh, and another one by one of my all-time favorite company relics from the past, Ambrosia Software (love you guys wherever you are these days), who created a wonderfully-brilliant series of games called Escape Velocity, which inspired my Sigma Shipyards apps, below with my other works.
