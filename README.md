Welcome!

I enjoy experimenting with how to build thoughtful and purposeful projects while creating fun and enjoyable experiences for the user. So far, I have explored color choice, sound, guiding users through UI presentation, and/or providing something of value to overall health and well-being.

About me:
- I'm an avid hiker, camper, climber, and all-around explorer of the rocky mountains west of Denver where I'm originally from. I'm perpetually fascinated with nature and outdoor recreation and incredibly passionate about environmental conservation. I'm also a huge fan astronomy and outerspace and see each as frontiers meriting further discovery.

- I spend quite of bit of time in the garden, as I enjoy working toward a goal piece by piece not just to look over the work I've accomplished when finished, but to enjoy the process. Just like with my coding. 

- I've always appreciated the value of a good video game since playing old 90's mac games, like the Heroes of Might and Magic series. (Thank you, New World Computing). Ambrosia Software, a now-relic of the past, also created a wonderfully-brilliant series of games called Escape Velocity, which inspired my Sigma Shipyards app below and is shown along with my other projects! So come have a look.

(^I'm fully capable of using a CSS framework, but decided it would be more fun to forego them and design things myself on this one :smiley:^)
