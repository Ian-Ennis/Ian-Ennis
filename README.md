Welcome!

I enjoy experimenting with how to build thoughtful and purposeful projects while creating fun and enjoyable experiences for the user. So far, I have explored color choice, sound, ways of progressing and guiding users through an application, and providing something of value to overall health and well-being.

About me:
I'm an avid hiker, camper, climber, and all-around explorer of the rocky mountains west of Denver where I'm originally from. I'm perpetually fascinated with nature and outdoor recreation. I'm also a huge fan astronomy and outerspace and see each as frontiers meriting further discovery. 

I spend quite of bit of time in the garden, as I enjoy working toward a goal piece by piece not just to look over the work I've accomplished when finished, but to enjoy the process. Just like with my coding. 

I've always appreciated the value of a good video game since playing old 90's mac games, like the Heroes of Might and Magic series. (Thank you, New World Computing). Ambrosia Software, a now-relic of the past, also created a wonderfully-brilliant series of games called Escape Velocity, which inspired my Sigma Shipyards app below and is shown along with my other projects! So come have a look.

Alt-H2 ➢ [Portfolio](https://ian-ennis.herokuapp.com/) | View my projects, see my stack, and learn who and what has inspired me to become the person I am at present. Welcome.


➢ [Evocation Station](https://github.com/Ian-Ennis/evocation_station) | Users can craft "Evocations" using pre-supplied materials or by uploading their own images, sounds, and text to create evocative posts. Includes a rich text editor for input text formatting. Utilized React, and Amazon Web Services S3 together with Rails ActiveStorage for file uploads and storage. 

➢ [Sigma Shipyards](https://github.com/Ian-Ennis/sigma_shipyards) | Game-focused spaceship builder with the purpose of guiding users through a journey in sci-fi space retro-futurism.

(^I am fully capable of using a CSS framework, but decided it would be more fun to forego them and design things myself on this one :smiley:^)


➢ [Leg-Up Activity Tracker](https://github.com/Ian-Ennis/activity_tracker) | A tool to provide fans of physical activity with the ability to record activity sessions for meditation, yoga, and cardio, with more activities on the way!


➢ [Cozy Cat Cafe](https://github.com/Ian-Ennis/phase_2_project_cozy_cat_cafe) | An online cat cafe, providing users the ability to view books and adoptable cats
