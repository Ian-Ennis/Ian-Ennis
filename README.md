Welcome!

About me:

I love to experiment with how to purposefully use code, while creating fun and enjoyable experiences for the user. So far, I have explored color choice, sound, different ways of progressing and guiding users through an application, or providing something of value to overall well-being.

I'm an avid hiker, camper, climber, and all-around explorer of the rocky mountains west of Denver where I'm originally from. I'm perpetually fascinated with nature, and enjoy packing a bag and a dog (just not in the bag, he's too big) and immersing myself in the woods for hours at a time. I'm also a huge fan astronomy and outerspace and see each as frontiers meriting further discovery. 

I was raised by social workers and believe in promoting mental health awareness. I think it should be integrated into everyone's set of perosnal values. 

I spend quite of bit of time in the garden, as I enjoy working toward a goal piece by piece not just to look over the work I've accomplished when finished, but to enjoy the process. Just like with my coding. 

I've always appreciated the value of a good video game since playing old 90's mac games, like the Heroes of Might and Magic series. (Thank you, New World Computing). Ambrosia Software, a now-relic of the past, also created a wonderfully-brilliant series of games called Escape Velocity, which inspired my Sigma Shipyards app below and is shown along with my other projects! So come have a look. 


➢ [Sigma Shipyards](https://github.com/Ian-Ennis/sigma_shipyards) | Game-focused spaceship builder with the purpose of guiding users through a journey in sci-fi space retro-futurism.

(^I am fully capable of using a CSS framework, but decided it would be more fun to forego them and design things myself on this one :smiley:^)


➢ [Leg-Up Activity Tracker](https://github.com/Ian-Ennis/activity_tracker) | A tool to provide fans of physical activity with the ability to record activity sessions for meditation, yoga, and cardio, with more activities on the way!


➢ [Cozy Cat Cafe](https://github.com/Ian-Ennis/phase_2_project_cozy_cat_cafe) | An online cat cafe, providing users the ability to view books and adoptable cats


➢ [Star Vault](https://github.com/Ian-Ennis/star_vault) | A friendly place for amateur astronomers to upload their interstellar discoveries
