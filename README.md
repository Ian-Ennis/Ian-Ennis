*cue cold open*

[chorus]

I didn't start the fire,
'Cause I'm always learning
Since the world's been turning;
I didn't start the fire
At first, I didn't get it
Hope I don't forget it

[end]


Thanks I'll be here all week


Hello! I'm Ian. I'm a recent bootcamp graduate, and now I'm immersed in the world of the head-spinning JOB SEARCH. Like, literally every day. Thankfully I have fun projects to work on to keep me sane. Oh yeah, and I had fun making above banner from scratch! Yep, and it is 100% being used on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-ennis-23b70915a/) as well (in the name of efficiency!).

Okay, so now the me part. 

I'm curious about languages and tools I don't know and I like to learn how to use them so I can give them meaningful applications, in.. well, applications. I also create music as witnessed ^above^ and enjoy many many other things, like nature and outdoor recreation, astronomy, mental health, and video games.. so seeing moose, and running away from charging moose; supernovas; fidget-spinners.. solid examples..

Okay okay, all jokes aside, I'm an avid hiker, camper, climber, and all-around explorer of the mountains west of Denver where I'm originally from. I am perpetually fascinated with outer space and astronomy. I was raised by social workers and believe in promoting mental health awareness. And I've always appreciated the value of a good video game since playing old 90's mac games, like Heroes of Might and Magic (thank you New World Computing). And another one by one of my all-time favorite software company relics from my childhood, Ambrosia Software (love you guys wherever you are these days). Ambrosia created a wonderfully-brilliant series of games called Escape Velocity, which inspired my Sigma Shipyards apps, appearing first above my other works.
