*que cold open*
[chorus]
I didn't start the fire,
'Cause I'm always learning
Since the world's been turning;
I didn't start the fire
At first, I didn't get it
Hope I don't forget it
[end]

Thanks I'll be here all week

Hi! I'm Ian. I'm a recent bootcamp graduate, and now I'm immersed in the world of the head-spinning JOB SEARCH. Like, literally every day. Thankfully I have fun projects to work on to keep me sane. Oh yeah, and I had fun making this banner! I'm curious about languages and tools I don't know and I like to learn how to use them so I can give them meaningful applications, in.. well, applications. I also create music as witnessed ^above^ and enjoy many many other things, like nature and outdoor recreation, astronomy, mental health, and video games.. so basically things like coyotes, walking by coyotes, supernovas, fidget-spinners, and an old 90's game called Heroes of Might and Magic (thank you New World Computing). Oh, and another one by one of my all-time favorite company relics from the past, Ambrosia Software (love you guys wherever you are these days), who created a wonderfully-brilliant series of games called Escape Velocity, which inspired my Sigma Shipyards application below. 

Yep, this banner is totally being used on my LinkedIn as well, which can conveniently be found on line 22.

The week of March 7th - 13th:
- I’m currently working on refactoring my projects, connecting with folks outside my network, and continually discovering how I can apply code to my interests!
- I’m currently learning different kinds of algorithms, more React hooks like useSound to add a dynamic to my ship-builder app, styling using bare-bones CSS, and how to grow my online presence

- Fun fact of the week: I was once chased by an Elk while riding my bycicle years while while working for Grand Canyon. They can run fast.
